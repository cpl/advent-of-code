Day  | Solutions | Problem
---: | :-------- | :----------
0x01 | C         | [Link][p1]
0x02 | C         | [Link][p2]
0x03 | C         | [Link][p3]
0x04 | Py        | [Link][p4]
0x05 | Go        | [Link][p5]

Note: Solutions are not meant to be in optimal time or memory! My wish/goal for
Advent of Code 2018 is to work the problems in as many languages as possible, depending
on how much free time I have.
