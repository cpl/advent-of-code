# Advent of Code

For me, each year is worthy of a theme.

- [2018](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/tree/year/2018) was "as many languages as possible"
- [2019](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/tree/year/2019) was "Go", but only did 2 days (doing Intcode problems in 2022 for fun)
- [2020](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/tree/year/2020) was also "Go", but got to day 12
- [2021](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/tree/year/2021) was "TDD (Test driven development)"
- [2022]() is "Functional Programming" in Go

## Ideas for future years

- [ ] Use the MU0 simulator and solve everything in ASM
- [ ] Scratch
- [ ] Typescript with Web view
