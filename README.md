# Advent of Code

For me, each year is worthy of a theme.

- [2018](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/commit/faf662caa63b128390b5f436b0d0013eaec21405) was "as many languages as possible".
- [2019](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/commit/e7de1ffe8ad61cd7b40d485bb9a26c3bc8aa81ad) was "Go", but only did 2 days.
- [2020](https://github.com/cpl/advent-of-code/commit/002a836e8bdae61c9d9de78319d73e787d1dbdb4) was also "Go", but got to day 12.
- [2021]() is "TDD (Test driven development)"

## Ideas for future years

- [ ] Use the MU0 simulator and solve everything in ASM
- [ ] Scratch
- [ ] Typescript with Web view
