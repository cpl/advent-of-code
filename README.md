* Note: Solutions are not meant to be in optimal time or memory! My wish/goal for Advent of Code 2018 is to work the problems in as many languages as possible, depending on how much free time I have.
* Note: Most of the problems could be highly optimized.
* Note: I said that I want to solve the problems in as many languages as possible, but turns out it's quite fun (and easy) to solve them in Python. Might try some visualization in the future.
